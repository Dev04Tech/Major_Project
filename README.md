# Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection

Humans are used to non verbal communication. The emotions expressed increases the clarity of any thoughts and ideas. It becoms quite interesting when a computer can capture this complex feature of humans, ie emotions. This topic talks about building a model which can detect an emotion from an image. There key points to be followed are:

1. Data gathering and  augmentation

   The dataset taken was **"fer2013"**. Image augmentation was performed on this data.

2. Model building

   The model architecture consists of CNN Layer, Max Pooling, Flatten and Dropout Layers.

3. Training

   The model was trained  by  using variants of above layers mentioned in model building and by varying hyperparameters. The best model was able to achieve 60.1% of validation accuracy.

4. Testing

   The model was tested with sample images. 

#### The model will be able to detect 7 types of emotions:-
  Angry , Sad ,  Neutral ,  Disgust ,  Surprise ,  Fear  , and   Happy
